# GROUND RULES

1. We are an open book organisation. The notion is to have minimal secrecy and maximum openness in every aspect of the organisation.
2. Our default choice of software is open source. eg: Use **ubuntu** for development instead of windows Free tools are preferable unless we have no choice. For the time being we prefer(***slack*** ,***google***, ***jira***, ***github***, ***visual studio code***)
3. **Some of the recommendations for being an effective learner**
     - [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects ( a course you can use from Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
     - Use Grammarly for writing (mandatory)
     - Give feedback to each other
     - Collaborate, mentor, share, improve
     - [Listen to Jordan Peterson on YouTube, listen what's relevant to you or start here( a youtube video link which is helpful)](https://youtu.be/9nL1rEk8wjo)
     - Plan your day by journaling (recommended, explore bullet generaling for planning)
     
4. ***Talents should attend their daily standups and if you are unable to attend, mention the reason at least half an hour prior to the meeting in the hitalent section.***(mandatory)

5.In the **case of leaves**, Talents need to **inform in hitalent group on slack.** 

6.The ***stipend*** is divided into different levels ranging from ***1000-20000***. You will jump from one level to the other based on your performance and 
on whether you are engaged on a live project or not.

7.Talents can **help each other** with their doubts and you also can raise your doubts in the hitalent section in the slack. All of this raises your karma which is also 
 something that can be converted to money eventually.
 
 8.Be punctual in your work.
